# Big Spuntino Website

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the **Big Spuntino** restaurant website, a modern and simple site designed to showcase an Italian day bar in Hamburg-Winterhude.  
Inspired by the clean and elegant design of **Die Tagesbar**, with additional references from **Big Squadra** and **Bambini Restaurant**, this site is responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing—reflecting the Mediterranean charm and Italian culinary heritage of Big Spuntino.
